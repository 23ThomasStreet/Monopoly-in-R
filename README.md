_**Monopoly_R V.1.0:**_

Monopoly in R is a Monopoly simulator to quickly simulate a select amount of games
and get descriptive statistics of the outcomes. The project is made to be easy to 
tweak so that the user can see how different rules in Monopoly produce different 
results. (NOTE TO SELF: "I should try using R.shiny for my game.")
